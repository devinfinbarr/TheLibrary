summary:
Not only was Stedman a Colonel in the British Army, he was born in Philadelphia - and commanded a Loyalist corps against the rebel forces. Moreover, he is a trained lawyer and clearly has read his Thucydides, of whom his tone and content are quite reminiscent.  Colonel Stedman's history is accurate, clear, and not at all dry.
